- Creates buy-in and reduces resistance
- Establishes respect for customer's time

b) Value-First Approach
- Quote: "If we were willing to offer you more money, more money than what your car was worth, would you mind if I told you how much that was?"

3. Objection Handling

a) "I love my car" Objection
Response: "Totally understand. Listen, if your house is worth $100,000 and someone is going to give you 500 grand for it, you'd probably give them two minutes of your time, right?"
- Uses analogy to reframe perspective
