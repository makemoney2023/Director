  - Gross Margin: 80%
  - LTV: $900,000 (3-year)
  - CAC: $50,000
  - LTV/CAC Ratio: 18:1
  - Payback Period: 6 months

**Presenter Notes:**

#### Breaking Down Our Unit Economics

1. **Annual Contract Value (ACV) - $300,000/year**
   - What it means: "This is what a typical enterprise customer pays us annually"
   - Breakdown: 
     - Base platform: $25,000/month = $300,000/year
     - Average customer starts with 50,000 minutes of voice interaction
     - Additional usage and services typically add 25-40% more revenue

2. **Gross Margin - 80%**
   - What it means: "For every $100 in revenue, we keep $80 after direct costs"
   - Cost breakdown:
     - Voice processing: $0.05/minute
     - Infrastructure: ~10% of revenue
     - Support costs: ~5% of revenue
   - Industry context: "Enterprise SaaS average is 70-75%" [OpenView Partners]

3. **Lifetime Value (LTV) - $900,000**
   - What it means: "Each customer generates $900K in profit over 3 years"
   - Calculation:
     - $300K annual revenue × 3 years = $900K revenue
     - 80% gross margin = $720K gross profit
     - Additional services and usage typically add $180K
   - Conservative estimate: "We're only counting 3 years, though customers typically stay longer"

4. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) - $50,000**
   - What it means: "We spend $50K to acquire each enterprise customer"
   - Breakdown:
     - Sales team costs: ~$30K
     - Marketing allocation: ~$15K
     - Implementation support: ~$5K
   - Industry context: "Enterprise SaaS CAC typically ranges from $100K-$200K" [SaaS Capital]

5. **LTV/CAC Ratio - 18:1**
   - Simple explanation: "For every $1 we spend acquiring a customer, we make $18 back"
   - Industry benchmark: "Healthy SaaS companies aim for 3:1" [OpenView Partners]
   - Our advantage: "We're 6x more efficient than the industry standard"
   - Why it matters: "This efficiency allows us to:
     - Invest aggressively in growth
     - Maintain strong margins
     - Achieve faster path to profitability"

6. **Payback Period - 6 months**
   - What it means: "We recover our customer acquisition cost in just 6 months"
   - Calculation:
     - Monthly revenue: $25,000
     - Gross margin: 80% = $20,000 monthly profit
     - CAC ($50,000) ÷ Monthly profit ($20,000) = 2.5 months
   - Industry context: "Enterprise SaaS average is 15-18 months" [SaaS Capital]

#### Why These Metrics Matter
1. **Capital Efficiency**
   - Every $1M invested in sales/marketing = $18M in customer lifetime value
   - Faster reinvestment cycle than competitors
   - Strong unit economics enable rapid, profitable scaling
