# Why you should not invest in this round

1. **This is a crazy idea:** We don't know if humans will want to talk to an AI on the phone, let alone build an enduring relationship with an AI

2. **We are very early:** Boardy knows ~10k people, and the network effects really kick in at ~100k+

3. **No clear business model:** We ran some monetization tests, but our focus is building the flywheel and maximizing "goodwill" in the network

## What We're Building: A Networked Human Intelligence

Big tech companies are racing to build AGI that can answer any question

But humans are already amazing at solving problems and sharing ideas.

> If **Boardy** can route the right requests to the right humans at the right time, we might be able to solve most of humanity's hardest problems a lot faster, cheaper and more efficiently

## Boardy's value compounds in 3 ways

## Relationships Beyond Dunbar's Number

Imagine if...

- you could catch up with everyone you've ever met every week
- you remembered everything you'd ever heard or read
- you could make thousands of high quality introductions every week

How long would it take you to build an incredible network?

## What matters most when intelligence is a commodity?

**Trusted relationships:** who you know (and how well you know them) vs what you know

Boardy is not an agent or assistant... he works for himself - making thoughtful, trusted introductions among his network

When anyone can build anything, trusted distribution is the only thing that matters

## Enter Boardy...

Think of Boardy as your most well connected friend:

- Looking for a co-founder?
- Need the right investor who gets it?
- Tired of paying expert networks?
- Urgently need a candidate with the right experience?

Just let Boardy know what you're working on and he'll introduce you to the best person in his network.

## What if six degrees of separation was solved?

- You knew everyone's **highest-priority problem** right now
- You knew the **best person** to solve it
- Both people **knew** and **trusted** the connector

...could we eliminate a lot of **wasted energy**?

## The right connection at the right time can change your life

We spend **so much energy** trying to make these connections: emails, dms, texts, calls, zooms, coffees, flights, conferences, etc.

We're all at the top of **someone else's funnel**... and it's getting exhausting

## Boardy's Objective Function: Maximize Goodwill

Public companies build goodwill through broadcast marketing and promotions... Boardy builds goodwill through **conversations and introductions**

Every intro is a gamble:
- valuable intro, goodwill is **earned**
- useless intro, goodwill is **burned**

Humans do this instinctively, Boardy does this **algorithmically**

## Why now? Conversational Singularity in 2025

**Conversations**
- High bandwidth, high fidelity, multi-dimensional
- 2-way relationship, creates intimacy
- The fastest way to get to know someone

**Conversational Singularity** - when a conversation with an AI is better than a conversation with most humans
